Excellent question. This gets to the crucial details that ensure an API like Hume's works reliably.

Based on Hume's official API documentation, here are the precise technical requirements for audio input beyond just the .wAV format:

Hume AI Audio Input Specifications (EVI API)
Feature	Requirement	Why It Matters
File Format	.wav (Waveform Audio File Format)	The container format that supports the required encoding.
Encoding	Linear PCM (Pulse-Code Modulation)	Uncompressed, raw audio data ensures no artifacts from compression (like MP3) that could distort emotion-relevant features.
Sample Rate	16 kHz (16,000 Hz) or higher	Must be at least 16kHz to capture the full frequency range of human speech. A higher rate (e.g., 44.1kHz) is acceptable and will be automatically resampled.
Bit Depth	16-bit	Standard for CD-quality audio. Provides a sufficient dynamic range (65,536 possible values) to accurately represent amplitude (volume) nuances.
Channels	1 (Mono)	Stereo audio is not necessary for speech analysis and can complicate processing. All input is converted to mono.
File Size	< 10 MB	A practical limit for API payloads. This translates to several minutes of audio at the required specifications.
Duration	Recommended: 3-15 seconds	Ideal for capturing a full spoken phrase or sentence. Much longer files may be truncated or time out.
How to Ensure Your Audio Meets These Specs
You can use Librosa or PyDub to explicitly convert any incoming audio to this exact specification before sending it to Hume or any other similar API.
